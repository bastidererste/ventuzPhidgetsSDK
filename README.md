VentuzPhidgetsSDK
===============

Encoders are often used to track moving elements on a stage like screens on a linear motor or cars on turntables. You can hook up rotary encoders directly to the back of steppermotors or connect them with a gearwheel to reduce rotation speed.
This script uses the phidget controller an the phidges SDK for .NET to implement position tracking into Ventuz.
